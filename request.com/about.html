                <p>BCC: THE HISTORY In 1998, Gov. Luis R. Villafuerte had first announced his plans of establishing a Community College in Baao. <br>The governor mentioned it during the launching of his VCPSE at Baao High School. The vision was reaffirmed after two years (2000) <br> when the governor attended the inauguration of another Reading Center he granted for Baao High School – San Vicente Campus and during the  <br>Division Secondary Education Day at Baao High School on March 18 of the same year. Mr. Gilbert Sadsad, the principal of Baao High School that <br> time supported the governor’s idea. He ordered Mrs. Eleanor B. Montaña, Math Program Head Teacher of Baao High School to confer with the governor <br> on the matters of the project. Mrs. Montaña was accompanied by Mr. Francisco Bulalacao, a PEHM Head Teacher of Baao High School when the opportune time <br> came to talk to the governor. They were endorsed to Atty. Ernesto Tino for the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement between the prospective staff of the new College, <br> and the Provincial Governor’s Office for bursary. That College is here and after known as Baao Community College (BCC).The vision to build the college continued to progress as<br> Mr. Gilbert Sadsad employed the expertise of Mr. Raul S. Adupe in the formulation of the first BCC curriculum. Mr. Adupe came up with the curriculum designs for the following courses:<br> Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science in Education, Two-year Computer Programming. On the Memorandum of Agreement dated June 5, 2000, the first line up of BCC administration, <br>faculty and support personnel was appointed. They are referred to in the MOA as project implementers, namely; Mr. Gilbert Sadsad as the administrator,Mrs. Eleanor Montaña as <br>the Registrar, Mr. Hilario Aurellano as the Property Custodian, Mrs. Leonida Llanes and Mrs. Marites Brigola as Librarians. Ten faculty members from Baao High School <br>complied with the qualifications and requirements to teach in this College and were therefore authorized as a part-time instructors; they were, Ms. Maria Shiela Bolalin, <br>Mrs. Yolanda Bogtong, Mr. Aaron Badong, Mr.Jovencio Alvina, Mr. Roldan Bulalacao, Mr. Nestor Baesa and Ms. Nancy Alio, Mr. Isidro Buere, Mr. Rodel Salvador and<br> Mr. Raul Adupe were also hired and completed the array of faculty members as the College starts. Baao Community College finally opened its door for enrolment on<br> June 13, 2000.The College welcomed 198 enrollees to mark its birth. The rush of events brought radical problems in the initial months of operation.  <br>Facilities such as rooms, textbook, library and computers were the first to be resolved. Through the plausible efforts of Mr. Sadsad, the College was able to obtain a permit <br> from Dr. Corazon E. Malaya (DECS Personnel) authorizing the use of DECS facilities (Baao High School) after five O’clock in the afternoon which is the regular close of DECS classes <br>. For the most part, Baao High School faculty rooms were sacrificed to accommodate classes for the College.  <br>These, along with many other sacrifices were entailed for providing higher learning opportunities to students of Baao Community College. Within a year, <br>the name Baao Community College reverberated farther than the local community; it gained praises as well as adverse responses from the people. Such as formerly, <br>when its legal personality as an educational institution was questioned. This controversy led CHED-Director Dominador Peralta to send a fact-finding committee for the College.<br>the fact-finding team ascertained the problems that need to be settled for the College to continue its operation. Fortuitously, all the requirements were  <br>accomplished through the hard work of the staff and implementers. The Baao Community College had been revived. In the process of securing a permit,<br> CHED-Director Dominador E. Peralta, Camarines Sur Polytechnic College (CSPC) President Dr. Lourdes Laniog and BCC Administrator Mr. Gilbert Sadsad convened in the <br>CHED Regional Office, Legazpi City. Upon the agreement made therein, BCC courses have to be affiliated with the CSPC courses. Also, students of BCC taking ROTC/WATC <br>had to cross-enroll at CSPC for the meantime. In the affiliation of curricula, extensive changes occurred CSPC’s ladderized curriculum was absorbed by the College.<br>Bachelor of Arts was dissolved and its enrollees were integrated in either of the following courses; Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME), or <br> Bachelor of Electronics and Communication Engineering (BSECE), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED) or Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (BSIT),  <br>Two-year courses were dissolved and were changed to ladderized BSECE (Electronic and Communications Engineering) or BSME (Mechanical Engineering), and /or BSIT curriculum. <br> However, upon release of CHED’s permit to operate this design, another suggestion was made. That, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) be changed to a program  <br>that would offer Two-year Associate in Computer Technology (ACT) leading to Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). This was in contrast to prior program proposal  <br>which offers One-Year Certificate in computer Operation as its First Ladder. Conclusively, as part of CHED’s Standard Operating Procedures, they conducted another <br>inspection for the College, and BCC was again reproved. The College continues its endeavor of giving quality yet affordable education to the aspiring youth.  <br>As the school’s maxim says Ad Astra per Aspera, Baao Community College becomes more invincible as it continues to reach “to the stars by hard ways”</p>
